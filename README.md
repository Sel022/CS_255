Driver Pass System application development

The Driver Pass System is a comprehensive role-based platform designed to streamline the registration, verification, and approval process for drivers within an organization that also includes students, instructors, and administrators. Each role plays a distinct part in the system's workflow, ensuring accountability, transparency, and security.
At the core of the system is the driver onboarding process, which begins with a registration form where drivers submit essential information along with required documentation, such as their license and identification. Once submitted, the application enters a verification workflow managed primarily by administrators, who have full authority to approve, reject, or request additional information. Throughout this process, drivers can log in to a dedicated dashboard to track the real-time status of their applications and receive updates through both email and in-app notifications.

The admin dashboard serves as the control center for managing all driver-related activities. Administrators can review submitted documents, assign review tasks, and oversee application statuses. The system also supports multi-factor authentication to enhance login security and imposes a three-attempt limit on password entry to protect against brute-force attacks.
Instructors have limited access to driver information and may be involved in recommending drivers based on training or assessment data. Students, while having minimal interaction with the driver pass system, may view assigned driver details if relevant to their use case (e.g., for transport coordination).
Technologically, the system is built with a modern stack that includes Next.js for the frontend, Redux Toolkit for state management, and either Rust, Go, or Node.js on the backend. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database. All services are containerized using Docker and deployed via Render, ensuring scalable and isolated environments. The platform emphasizes security through JWT-based authentication, role-based access controls, and secure file handling for sensitive documents.

Client Requirements
Briefly summarize the Driver project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Sam and Jennifer, the clients of the Driver Pass System, require a secure and streamlined platform to manage the end-to-end process of driver onboarding and verification. The system should support four key user roles—Admin, Driver, Instructor, and Student—with clearly defined permissions. Drivers must be able to apply, upload necessary documents, and track their application status. Admins need the ability to review and approve these applications, while Instructors may support the process with evaluations. Students may also interact with the system in a limited capacity. The platform must enforce strong authentication, support scalable deployment, and maintain a user-friendly experience across all roles.
 Functional Requirement Overview
 What did you do particularly well? I did good in eliciting business requirements from the business owner and using different techniques, such as use cases, prototypes, and interviews. These methods help to define the business requirements to change into what functionality the business wants. For example, driver pass applications where students are able to create an account and then able to log in are functional requirements. Elaborate on what happens if students use an incorrect username and password and how they would reset their password. What types of verification methods are there? I documented all BRD and FRD clearly so the developers can understand easily how to build the driver pass application.
After engaging with key stakeholders including Sam and Jennifer.
I gathered and translated all business needs into clearly defined functional requirements for the Driver application. The platform supports multiple roles—Admin, Student, Instructor, and Driver—and is designed primarily to help students take online driving classes, schedule lessons, and track progress. These requirements guide the development process in building a system that aligns closely with both user needs and business goals.

 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you If I were to revise one part of the work on this document, I would refine the "Functional Requirements" section to be more visual and modular—perhaps breaking it down with flowcharts or using case diagrams and prototype modules where non-technical stakeholders are able to understand easily. To improve it, I would ask many questions about the product until every requirement is clearly defined for functionality requirements for development.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The first method of user needs can be achieved by conducting user research, and with a clear understanding of user goals, then make sure that the system should meet the user’s needs. The system should allow students to log in if they have an account created and are able to log in with the right username and password; if not, the system should throw an error: Account does not exist" or Invalid username and password. Make sure user needs lead to a bug- and error-free application where users are fully satisfied with the performance of the application. The user's needs are crucial because it ensures the system is practical and solves real problems. A user's design leads to higher satisfaction, better adoption for later revisions.
 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Clearly documenting what business problems, we try to solve and then translating them into functional requirements to implement the business goal I use techniques like stakeholder interviews, requirements gathering, and user journeys to get a clear picture of the system's purpose. In the future, I will continue using agile methodologies, scrum framework, where all the team members are connected, project management tool Jira, iterative prototyping, and feedback loops to refine the design early and often.
